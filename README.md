## Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenCV-Face-Recognition.git
   cd OpenCV-Face-Recognition
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
         pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Project**:
   To start face recognition, simply run the following command:
   ```bash
      python face_recognition.py
4. **Customize**:
   Modify the configuration in config.py to adjust parameters like the face recognition threshold or the training dataset.
